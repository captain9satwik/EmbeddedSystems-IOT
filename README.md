# EmbeddedSystems-IOT
## About Me

I work primarily in embedded systems and IoT, with a strong focus on microcontroller-based design, real-time data acquisition, and hardware–software integration. My interests lie in building reliable systems, interfacing sensors, and extracting meaningful insights from real-world data under constrained environments. I enjoy working close to the hardware and applying structured engineering and problem-solving principles to practical systems.
